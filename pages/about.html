        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Nowadays, there are so many different ways to connect with the world. But, do you ever feel
          like you're missing important moments or events that have been shared by those you care
          about the most? My Top 9 wipes away the clutter and the need to scroll aimlessly through
          your feed, so that you don't have to see your ex's grandmother's best friend's trip to Spain
          ever again. </p> 
        <p>We filter out the posts you actually want to see without having to hit that
            awkward "unfollow" button. You'll be kept in the loop with your best friends, and 
            feel like you haven't missed a beat. Even when you're thousands of miles away. </p>
